# 🎨📊 Digital Portfolio — BI, Analytics & Data Visualization

This repository hosts my **professional digital portfolio**, built and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.  
It brings together selected work across **Business Intelligence, Analytics Engineering, and Data Visualization**, combining production-style dashboards with more narrative and creative visualization projects.

The portfolio is intentionally structured to reflect how data work is delivered in real organizations:  
from **decision-ready dashboards and pipelines** to **story-driven visual communication**.

## 🧠 Design & Analytics Philosophy

This portfolio is guided by a few core principles:

- **Employer-first curation**  
  Projects are selected and framed with hiring managers and collaborators in mind.

- **Separation of function and expression**  
  Operational BI work and creative visualization are distinct, but complementary.

- **Story before tools**  
  Technology enables the work, but clarity and intent drive it.

- **Living portfolio**  
  The content of this repository evolves as new dashboards, projects, and experiments are completed.
